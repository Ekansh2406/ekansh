# Deployment Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to deploy two projects, Nutrient-Tracker and TIP, using Docker containers on localhost. The Nutrient-Tracker project is a Ruby on Rails application, while the TIP project is a Next.js application. Both projects were configured and deployed using Docker Compose.

## Repositories
- **Nutrient-Tracker**: A Ruby on Rails project.
- **TIP**: A Next.js project.

## Tasks
### Deploy Both Projects Using Docker Compose
1. **Dockerfiles**: Created Dockerfiles for both projects to define the environment and dependencies.
2. **docker-compose.yml**: Configured a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage the deployment of both projects.

### Network Configuration
- **TIP Project**: Mapped to port 3001 on localhost.
- **Nutrient-Tracker Project**: Attempted to map to a chosen port on localhost.

### Network Types
- **Bridge Network**: We used the bridge network for this setup because it provides the ideal balance of isolation, security, and inter-container communication for a local development environment. 

## Deliverables
### Setup Process
1. **Dockerfiles**: Created Dockerfiles for both projects.
2. **docker-compose.yml**: Configured the `docker-compose.yml` file to define services, networks, and volumes.
3. **Running Containers**: Verified running containers using `docker ps`.
4. **Accessing Websites**: Accessed the TIP project successfully on port 3001.

### Issues Encountered
- **Nutrient-Tracker Project**: Encountered issues with deploying the Nutrient-Tracker project. Despite configuring the Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml`, the project did not run successfully on the chosen port.

### Screenshots
- **Running Containers**: Provided a screenshot of the running containers using `docker ps`.
- **Accessing TIP Project**: Provided a screenshot of accessing the TIP project in the browser.

## Conclusion
While the TIP project was successfully deployed and accessible on port 3001, the Nutrient-Tracker project encountered deployment issues. Further troubleshooting is required to resolve the issues with the Nutrient-Tracker project.
